.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cyphertite

.Op Fl B Ar mdfile
.Op Fl C Ar tmpdir
.Op Fl F Ar conffile  
.Op Fl f Ar mdfile

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command creates, lists, or extracts files using an archive metadata file
and remotely stored blocks of data, called
.Dq chunks .
A
.Dq chunk
is defined as a portion of a file on disk that is up to 256
KB in size. (A file that is larger than 256 KB would be
split into several 256 KB chunks and one chunk that might be less than
256 KB.)
.Pp
The interface is designed to be familiar to users of tar while
providing a number of additional features:
.Pp
DEDUPLICATION
.Bd -filled -offset 3n
Through the process of 
DEDUPLICATION,
.Nm
chunks 
are stored only once and subsequent instances of
the same data are stored as references to the existing data.
Files (called "archive metadata files") reference the chunks needed to
retrieve any archived file.
Each chunk is identified by its SHA1 hash. 
Many archive metadata files may reference the same chunk.
.Ed
.Pp
COMPRESSION
.Bd -filled -offset 3n
After files are split into chunks, those chunks are then compressed.
The default compression algorithm is LZO because it is the fastest
of the 3 algorithms available, but LZW or LZMA can be 
configured in 
.Xr cyphertite.conf 5 .
If a chunk increases in size on compression, the uncompressed
chunk is used.
.Ed
.Pp
ENCRYPTION
.Bd -filled -offset 3n
.Nm
encrypts each chunk after compression. The encryption algorithm used
is 256-bit AES-XTS
with a variation on the usual disk encryption method suggested
in IEEE 1619-2007: the 256-bit tweak key, K2, is normally taken
as the sector number on a hard drive, here it is generated as an
HMAC SHA1 of the chunk itself using a separate 256-bit key.

All locally stored metadata is unencrypted. Metadata stored on
a remote machine is encrypted using standard AES-XTS, with the 
HMAC SHA1 of the chunk number used as the tweak key.

Network traffic is encrypted using per-user certificates signed
by a 521-bit ECDSA CA key and a corresponding per-user 521-bit
ECDSA key.
These certificates and keys are used to setup a 256-bit AES
session key for SSL.
The relevant client certificates and key are provided by the
remote server administrator.

The keys used to perform all the chunk-level encryption are
stored in the crypto_secrets file specified in 
.Xr cyphertite.conf 5 .
The file ~/.cyphertite.crypto is the default.
The AES-XTS and IV keys are stored protected by PBKDF2 with a
default of 256,000 rounds and a 128-byte salt.
The password to unlock the AES-XTS and IV keys is specified as
crypto_password in
.Xr cyphertite.conf 5 .
.Ed
.Pp
REALM DEDUPLICATION
.Bd -filled -offset 3n
If multiple machines share
.Xr cyphertite.conf 5
and cyphertite.crypto files in common, deduplication can be
achieved across several machines in a realm.
These machines must share an account to obtain the benefit
of deduplication. 
.Ed
.Pp
In all cases except those involving metadata (
.Fl m
), the path to the archive metadata file is required:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar metadata
Filename where the archive metadata is stored.
For list and extract commands this is the existing archive metadata file
to extract from. For create commands it is the archive metadata file to
create.
.El
.Pp
One of the following flags must be present:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Create new archive or overwrite an existing archive metadata file.
.It Fl t
List contents of an archive.
If any files are named on the command line, only those files will
be listed. The
.Ar file
arguments may be specified as
.Xr glob 7
patterns (or, with the
.Fl r
option, 
.Xr regex 3 
patterns) and
.Nm
will list all archive members that match that pattern.
.It Fl x
Extract files from archive.
If any files are named on the command line, only those files will
be extracted from the archive.
The
.Ar file
arguments may be specified as 
.Xr glob 7
patterns (or, with the
.Fl r
option, 
.Xr regex 3 
patterns) and
.Nm
will extract all archive members that match that pattern.
.El
.Pp
In addition to the flags mentioned above, the following flags may be
used:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B Ar mdfile
Specify the archive to be used as the basis of a differential backup. 
Files with a modification time (mtime) newer than the previous backup
will be archived.
The behavior is dump-like and helps limit the size of the archive metadata
file and the backup window.
.It Fl C Ar directory
Set the current working directory.  When extracting, files will be
extracted into the specified directory; when creating, the specified
files will be matched from the directory.
.It Fl F Ar config
Specify the location of the configuration file to use, overriding
the default values.
.It Fl P
Do not strip leading slashes
.Pq Sq /
from pathnames.
The default is to strip leading slashes.
.It Fl R
Display statistics at the end of operation.
These include compression ratios, transfer speeds, byte details, etc.
.It Fl X
The option prevents 
.Nm
from descending into directories that have a different device number
than the file from which the descent began.
.It Fl d
Run in debug mode.
.It Fl e
Deletes a remotely stored archive metadata file.  The option is used in
conjunction with -m.
.It Fl m
run in metadata mode.
See
.Sx METADATA MODE
for an explanation.
.It Fl p
Preserve user and group ID as well as file mode regardless of the
current
.Xr umask 2 .
.It Fl r
Enable
.Xr regex 3
matching.  The default is to use
.Xr glob 7 .
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.It Fl V
Display version information.  All other options are ignored.
.El
.Sh METADATA MODE
If
.Fl m
is provided on the command mode then 
.Nm
will operate in metadata mode.
The
.Fl x ,
.Fl c
and
.Fl t
commands now operate on the remote archive metadata store.
Additionally
.Fl e
may be used to delete remote metadata from the server.
.Sh METADATA OPERATION MODES
Two different metadata modes are supported by
.Nm :
.Em local
and
.Em remote .
In
.Em local
mode,
.Nm 
operates similarly to
.Xr tar 1
with the archive metadata files operating analgously to the tar archive
files.
.Pp
In
.Em remote
mode,
.Nm
will instead operate on metadata stored on the remote server.
In this case the names provided by
.Fl f
are used as tags to the metadata.
They are stored on the remote server with the form:
YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-tag .
Extract commands will operate on the newest archive metadata file on the
server unless the full metadata name is provided.
The cache directory defined in the 
.Xr cyphertite.conf 5 
configuration file will be used to store
local copies of the archive metadata files.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create an archive named 
.Pa accounting-2010.md
containing the directory
.Pa /data/accounting/2010 :
.Pp
.Dl $ cyphertite -cf accounting-2010.md /data/accounting/2010
.Pp
Verbosely create an archive named
.Pa pictures.md ,
of all files matching
.Xr regex 3
pattern
.Pa *.jpg :
.Pp
.Dl $ cyphertite -rcvf pictures.md *.jpg
.Pp
Perform a differential backup of an archive named
.Pa htdocs-201104.md .
Files in
.Pa /var/www/htdocs
whose modification times (mtime) are newer than in previous
backup
.Pa htdocs-201104.md
will be archived.
.Pp
.Dl $ cyphertite -B htdocs-201104.md -cf htdocs-201105.md /var/www/htdocs
.Pp
Extract files from archive
.Pa backup.md
into directory
.Pa restore .
.Pp
.Dl $ cyphertite -C restore -xf backup.md
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "cyphertite" -compact
.It Pa /etc/cyphertite/cyphertite.conf
Default configuration file.
.It Pa ~/.cyphertite.conf
User configuration file.
.It Pa ~/.cyphertite.crypto
Default crypto secrets file.

.Sh CAVEATS
.Pp
.Nm
is currently in beta testing.  Some of the above options
may change before official release.
When running the first backup on a system,
.Nm
prompts the user for the information needed to setup the
account as follows:
.Dl $ cyphertite -cf backup.md /usr/local/bin
.Dl ct config file not found. Create one? [yes]: 
.Dl Target conf file [/root/.cyphertite.conf]: 
.Dl ct login username: mylogin
.Dl Save ct login password to configuration file? [yes]: 
.Dl login password: 
.Dl confirm: 
.Dl Save ct crypto passphrase to configuration file? [yes]: 
.Dl Automatically generate crypto passphrase? [yes]: 
.Dl Configuration file created.
.Dl No crypto secrets file. Creating
.Pp
Using the built-in configuration file generator simplifies
the install substantially.
